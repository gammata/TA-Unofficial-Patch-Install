**New rendering settings (cnc-ddraw) - by [FunkyFr3sh](https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh)**

The game will now run by default in borderless mode, use **cnc-ddraw config.exe** to configure your rendering settings.

To use original mouse sensitivity, disable **Adjust mouse sensitivity**

To improve the visual quality, change the **OpenGL Shader** setting in **Advanced settings** (Borderless/Upscaled only)

Screen recording is now possible via **Game Capture** in OBS

If your **Presentation** setting is set to either **Fullscreen** or **Windowed** you can also press **Alt+Enter** to switch between Windowed and Fullscreen mode during runtime

Other new hotkeys:
[Ctrl] + [Tab] = Unlock cursor
[Right Alt] + [Right Ctrl] = Unlock cursor
